__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment My fiancé works next door at the wedding floral shop, Tabletops Etc, and we've been waiting anxiously for Mother Bunch to open and we were not disappointed!   First off, as avid proponents of historic preservation, they did an amazing job with the building. Big windows to the street, the cool oval bar and a window in back peeking into the kitchen, it's perfect!   The food is fantastic, and quite a step above usual bare fare. Since MBB is staking their name on their beer it may have been tempting to skimp on food quality but they certainly didn't. I had the delicious pork chops which came with some or the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  As for the drinks, I'm a teetotaler so I stuck to their cream soda which was very thick, rich and delightful. My fiancée had a few cocktails I can't recall the names of, but gave them a big thumbs up. The beer drinkers at our table were very much looking forward to returning once MBB has their own beer ready to go.  MBB is EXACTLY the type of business downtown Phoenix needs lots more of and I hope you'll support it. Keep in mind it's brand new so kinks like parking, service time, etc are still likely being ironed out. I have a feeling MBB is going to become a major area landmark and really help connect Garfield with Roosevelt Row and Evans Churchill.
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment Such a  nice surprise walking along front w here. An Indy coffee shop w super chill owners and wonderful conversation. Such a gem in such a residential, business minded neighbourhood. It really is a breath of fresh air. Very intimate, get pricing for quality products and service. A must see when in the neighbourhood. Will return!
Sammy's is truly the way students should be eating. Healthy and fresh food from breakfast all the way to dinner (+ they have a bar and have open mic nights and such). It's a little hidden with a small doorway through the wall of Hart House that leads down to this golden place.  By far their best is their chicken lunch plate. One piece of chicken breast (rather large although some pieces are small - honey garlic, tandoori, jerk, plain, and another marinade) and salad, with rice or potatoes and some mushroom sauce for $6/7. A little expensive but by far the best food you can get close to UofT and it's a completely meal.  Breakfasts include either the standard eggs and sausage fair but also french toast and pancakes and such for around $3. They also have these bottled blue/white leaf tea's that are really good and I haven't found them anywhere else!  Their menu is online but they have everything from salads, to falafels, chicken, fresh pizza, freshly made desserts but it's not really fast food, they bake it nicely and make it good without the grease.  If you're visiting UofT, this isn't a bad place to have a meal at.
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment When my friend texted me to see if I want to go have Peruvian food at El Chullo, I was very excited. As adventurous as my palate is, I had never been to this local gem. LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! The ambiance, the people, the fact that a mother and father along with their two sons run this place was a huge plus for me. Along with their Momma, the sons are the chefs creating some of their own along with recipes handed down by their ancestors. The flavors are incredible. I can't wait to take the family back. Another fabulous local go to place for me... Woohoo!!!!
I read about this place on BlogTO but was disappointed with the food. I had the chicken curry, takoyaki, okonomyaki, and kimchi fries. The prices were decent but I would not go back.
I just got takeout delivered and it was absolutely horrible! The soup was water with a few mushrooms floating in it, the pad thai had an aftertaste and the beef in the curry was rough and super chewy.. So disappointed, never again!
The turkey pastrami burger was amazing.. my only regret was that I couldn't eat more than 1 entree haha
__label__experience_environment Zorfs is pretty awesome. Kenny the owner has really turned this place around over the last year since he took it over about a year ago. The patio is an awesome addition! And now they have a good size dance floor.  Phoenix's only pet friendly LGBT bar, have been here when people have their dogs and they play around in the grassy area out by the patio.  Wednesday nights are game night, and they give away a lot of cool gifts. Highly recommended neighborhood bar if you like to chill and meet new great people.
__label__experience_hospitality If you love sloppy noodles in ketchup with hidden shards of pointy plastic in it. This is the place for you.  Wanted something new near work. Thought I'd give them a try.  Ordered Pad Thai and a fresh salad roll. Got a deep fried spring roll and a big sharp piece of plastic in my first bite of the Pad Thai.  Barely an apology. They sent me a new order but only brought one of the 2 dishes I paid for. They didn't seem surprised or bothered about the fact sharp foreign object in my food over the phone.  In the end the pad Thai I got was pretty nasty. I was able to pick up the entire mass of noodles with my fork as it was all one solid knot of overcooked noodles covered in what may well have been ketchup. Actually I'm pretty sure it was ketchup.  The phone conversations were pretty stupid. In the end I didn't get a refund because it wasn't worth the annoying communication issues I had with the person on the phone.  Avoid.
__label__experience_hospitality I read great things about Yen and checked it out today for a business lunch. The service was amazing, it's easy to have a quick lunch there, and they have cheap sushi lunch specials, but I was there for a business lunch, and we stayed for 2+ hours. The service was above and beyond excellent. The two ladies serving us were always on standby for whatever we needed, right down to spotting my friend drop his napkin and bringing him a new one before he even realized he dropped it.  The food was incredible. I had read about a scallop appetizer and meant to order that, but instead ordered the Mussels with Dynamite Sauce. What a wonderful mistake it turned out to be. There were six large mussels on the half shell, served hot with a savory Dynamite sauce, scallions and fish eggs. They were excellent. We decided to order several rolls, including the Hot Night roll, the Spicy Tuna Tempura (amazing tempura sweet potato comes with this), and several others, as well as a few pieces of sushi, including the Yellowtail belly, which was delicious and super fresh.   Since our eyes were way bigger than our stomachs, we had our server box up the remaining food and she was kind enough to put the box on ice for me to keep the fish cold! Without asking!!!! In hindsight, I wish I had asked her name so I could put it in this review and give her props. Highly recommended and I will definitely be returning soon!
__label__experience_hospitality The salads here are big and flavorful and I really enjoy the warm cornbread that they bring out before your meal.  It's a nice difference from breads and rolls most restaurants serve.  I've never had to wait and the service this last time was great.  My water was continually filled (and I drink tons so it's a challenge with me). The first time I went I sat in the bar area and the service was significantly slower, but considering it was a weekend night I suppose it's somewhat understandable.  I will continue to meet up with friends here.
Used to be my fav AYCE place but its consistently lower and lower in sushi quality.   The salmon the last 3x is so fatty. And they've altered some previous rolls to make it easier/faster to make so there not as tasty.   Still a decent place but not what it used to be.
__label__experience_environment At the time I visited this place there were no other burrito places in the area.  I can tell you that I'm not surprised the food wasn't that great.  There was even a lineup too likely because the competitor down Yonge Street hadn't opened yet.    I had the chicken burrito which took quite some time even though there were more than 5 staff working behind the counter.  All of them looked confused and unsure of their duties.  My suggestion is either grab a hot dog just outside at Finch Station or make the extra trek down to Burrito Boyz a few blocks away.  If I could give 0 stars I would.
In my opinion, TLP has the best sandwiches in downtown Toronto. The Harrison is my favorite; however, all other sandwiches are great!
Go to Szechuan Express.  Just make sure what you get is fresh.  I always look for what's fresh before ordering.  Ruby Thai and A&W would be my second choices.  If you want salad and protein - maybe consider Jimmy The Greek.  I tried the Big Smoke across from Toronto Metro Library and it was good.  I never tried the one at Eaton Centre, but that might be a good choice too.  I hate the KFC here.  It's never fresh.  For visitors, the Urban Eatery is basically a food court.
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment Everything about this place is amazing - location, staff, patio and food! Very delicious food - wood fired grill makes a big difference. Great job guys!
__label__experience_hospitality I went for my first visit to Lux on a Wednesday morning at 8am.  Apparently I'm one of the few who had never been.  The place is packed.   But even with a line, the service was efficient.   Seating is "family style" - you sit a shared tables.  My latte was great and came with a leaf illustrated in the foam.  (Now these barista's deserve a tip jar!)   I ordered a breakfast sandwich and...I couldn't resist...I also tried their cranberry biscotti (I loved it!).  Careful...finding Lux is a bit confusing.   I actually drove by the store-front the first time.   Lux is located NEXT to Paine Bianco and Lux shares their parking lot.
__label__experience_environment Classy, calm atmosphere with beautiful Persian songs and delicious kebabs, food is pretty filling, non-greasy, yummy!! if you are in town for kebabs recommended, enjoy :)
__label__experience_environment Met a former colleague here for happy hour a week or 2 ago and was pleasantly surprised when I arrived by the ample parking out front and just how HUGE a place this is. I love the feel of it, very rustic and charming décor that really invites you in.   We sat at the bar and enjoyed some happy hour wine (on tap) and got some bites of food. the short rib potstickers were these awesome melt-in-your-mouth bites of goodness -highly recommend that. The fries were good too, HUGE serving of those and the brie toast was nice, nothing to write home about. I really liked the plating and the visual appeal of the food though, they do such a great job at all the Fox restaurants of recognizing we eat with our eyes first! Love the plating here. Overall, we had a blast, 2 hours flew by and my friend even got a yummy dessert and coffee with Baileys to complete our happy hour date. It was a great time, did the bar staff forget about us as they got busier - sure. Did the check come with a bit of sticker shock for a few apps, 2 wines and dessert - indeed. But its a great spot and I'd love to come back for brunch or something soon.
__label__experience_environment Awesome awesome awesome awesome brunch experience. There was a bit of a wait for Sunday brunch but the weather was really nice outside. So The wait gave me and my best friend a chance to look at the store Products of shirts  and mugs.we ended up purchasing two cool shirts that said #vodka. The shirts were great because the store makes its own vodkaWhat I did love about brunch was with the entrée you receive  a large glass a Mimosa for a penny & the mimosas were great Made with great champagne & didn't make it all bubbly for the day. My  choice of brunch  was the chicken and waffles . the waffles were great ,the bacon was cooked perfectly the chicken was seasoned. Great seating areas inside in out. The bar was very chaotic. Only thing I didn't like because it was also a gathering spot for people waiting for tables and to pay for merchandise. I ended up having my server run my card for the peso stuff. He didn't mind. Will be back they next time in Arizona
Spinatos has the best pizza in Phoenix by far! The sauce is delicious and the mamas signature spinach pizza is amazing! I can't resist the canoli for dessert, yum!!!
__label__experience_hospitality Thor produces an excellent latte. The flavour was slightly nutty and delicious without any added sugar or sweetener - I could sense no unpleasant bitterness whatsoever.   Service was friendly and price was average for these types of specialty coffee shops.
__label__experience_hospitality Sat. May 30th I went for the very first time.  I ordered the Big Breakfast.  It came quick and hot and there was so much food I could not finish it.  It reminded me of how DayBreak at Church & Carlon used to be before they cut back on portion sized and really jacked their prices.  If you are looking for a HUGE breakfast and not have to pay an excess amount I was wowed.  Great service too and it was busy; they needed a busser there were only 2 waitresses and they handed it all well but they really could have used an extra set of hands to bus tables.
Wow! This place is great. The breakfast specials are amazing. You can't go wrong with the steak and eggs or the 3  egg scrambled. The fresh squeezed orange juice and blueberry honey lemonade make everything feel right in the world. One thing you have to be prepared for is the wait since its first come first serve, but it's well worth it.
__label__experience_hospitality I had the special today the tamales.  They were very tasty and fresh.  The rice and beans were very tasty.  It's very refreshing to see homemade tortillas right there. The staff was nice and helpful. I will be back can't wait to try more.
I grew up in the neighborhood and for some reason I thought Chino Bandido was a buffet. I was way off! I can't believe I waited so long to eat here but I am a little worried about my addiction to their chile relleno burrito. I think Chino Bandido made a deal with the devil when they created the best chile relleno ever! Its not your average chile relleno made with an egg its more like a giant jalepeno popper. I get it every time I come here with a veggie quesadilla and top it off with their yummy salsa. I am also obsessed with the snickerdoodle cookies and I don't really like cookies. The ordering system is kind of weird but if you act like its your first time there they'll just fill it out for you ;)
__label__experience_environment I was jazzed to eat here, but saw a negative review by a fellow Yelper and thought "hmmmm....."  But that guy must have been in a bad mood because I loved it!  I went with 4 friends last Friday for dinner and none of us was disappointed right from the start.  The Tuck Shop is quite literally a shop tucked into the Coronado neighborhood in a quaint brick building.  The inside is reminiscent of  a ski lodge with the decorative wood ceiling runner and cozy lounge that is perfect for enjoying a glass of wine while you wait for a table - and you will wait if you go during peak dinner times on a weekend as the dining room is small.  The plates are designed for sharing, but are still relatively small.  That does however lend diners the chance to enjoy a few apps with friends and still have room to enjoy a solo meal.  We started with the fancy cheese sticks - yum - that come with some sort of a pear dipping sauce.  Interesting....and delicious!  We also enjoyed the grilled baguette with roasted garlic which was a creamy surprise.  The beers are brewed for the Tuck Shop by Four Peaks which was a great treat and all of us enjoyed both flavors.  That was a nice addition to the start of our meal.  We all must have similar palates because we didn't vary much in our meal choices.  Three had the Times Mac & Cheese w/ Lobsta and two enjoyed the skirt steak.  Both were delicious.  I am a huge mac & cheese fan and I really enjoyed this version.  It was creamy and flavorful and the lobster was a surprising and welcome addition!  For dessert we enjoyed the baked apple, and by "we" I mean "I enjoyed" as I mowed it before most of my friends had a chance!  It was the perfect light dessert for a great, and well portioned, meal.  Plus, my friends were all so happy with the chocolate covered cookie dough balls they were happy to leave me be.  We will certainly be back and I'm looking forward to it.
Stopped for lunch ... Took extra home for later .... Some dog the best bbq I've had in AZ
Cool place in the Junction neighborhood especially if you like craft beer! They always have something new to try and if you don't know what to pick...choose a tasting flight!
__label__experience_environment Nice little restaurant with very cozy and warm atmosphere in a busy downtown neighbourhoud. We came in for drinks and ordered a pizza and a cold platter to share, both were great. Affordable prices too... Will definitely visit again!
__label__experience_environment Yeah um this place rocks. Cool bar area. The bomb
__label__experience_environment this is a good old rowdy, party, have a good time bar. it's not fancy. it's geared to a very laid back crowd, alot of bikers and alot of people who like hard rock n roll. they crowd may look a little tough, but it's really a good mix of people. don't dress up here. you will stick out like a soar thumb. there is a full menu and the food is on the cheaper side. happy hour is 10-7! they have 35 cent wings all day long, i think everyday. not sure about the every day thing. there is a live band on fridays and probably saturdays and it's hard rock. there's a dance floor. it does get really busy and is generally alot of fun. it's dark due to lack of windows. there's alot of places to sit. a good all around time. not for kids at anytime.
Is give this place 0 stars if I could.  Invent here with my buddy after work and the food is boring as hell.  Good beer selection but damn... Enough with ripping off people with small expensive plate nonsense.  His place is also odd and the middle of the ghetto. Weird.
__label__experience_hospitality Great food, great service! This place has an amazingly wide and varied menu to choose from. I tried the Farmers Benedict and am in love! My fiance and I are already planning what to get the next time we make it in!
Tried to come before but it was closed.for thanksgiving holidays... Should not.have bothered trying again  .  Tried 4 tacos, asada, lengua, cabeza and fish. All were lukewarm/ cold and or bland. So disappointing given the reviews expected a lot more. fish taco tasted like it had been fried hours before just hard and cold. Best part of the meal was the rice and salsas... Side onions were also good.despite being cold... If I looking for tacos there are way tastier options available
__label__experience_hospitality Came in here on a Sunday night trying to kill a little time. The 4 of us sat at the bar, and little did we know but we were in for a show. Jake is hands down the best bartender in phoenix. We sat and watched in amazement as he created his masterpieces with care. None of us had anything specific in mind, so all we had to tell him was the kind of liquor we like, he would make a recommendation, and then make it. I'm a whiskey drinker, so he made an excellent (insert name here-because there is no name for it yet) drink, that was definitely what I was looking for. highly recommend coming down here and asking for him!
__label__experience_hospitality My best friend took me here my first night in town and it was wonderful. The salads are good and the pizza even better.  We didn't have to wait long for our food.  I heard the pasta dishes are just as good.  The best part is the customer service, from the friendly cashiers, front staff and waiters to the fact that the Manager was walking around and personally asking each table how everything was.  That says a lot, especially these days when customer service is forced and non-existent in most establishments.  I would suggest going here for a good meal and relaxing environment.
I'm a very busy profession that lacks time to cook healthy meals. My fit foods is a perfect solution for me! It has been a life saver. The meals are perfectly portioned and taste great!
__label__experience_hospitality Wow delicious and authentic Iraq food in Phoenix! #20 - Gyro Special Plate:  tasty and well seasoned gyro meat accompanied with crisp french fries, and a drink for only $7 #9 - Lamb Shank w/rice on a bed of basmatti rice served with soup, bread (baked on site), a smoked hummus and macaroni salad appetizers all for $13.  Unfortunately the server was authentic Iraq too, not bringing the silverware until after we got our first dishes, and bringing the appetizers 5 min or so after the main course.  However she was very friendly.  We're told Sun (1-5 pm) buffet $15/person has a great spread of Iraq food.
__label__experience_hospitality My friends wanted to give this place another try seeing as we were in the area and wanted something cheap. Even though I don't recommend it. Still same thing happened, placed us in a tiny cubicle of a table even though we clearly don't fit comfortably. A bigger table was available so we moved there after asking the wait staff. Service was way slow and food came after 40 min. We were starving. My friend got cold wings but was so hungry he didn't send them back. I gave it 1 star in the past, still a 1.
__label__experience_hospitality I wanted to eat breakfast on the cheap side but like everyone else that cares about there life did not want McDonald's .  This place was not busy and I know why service and food subpar . Ok I take over and manage it first order fire the server who rather talk then serve second and most important fire the breakfast cook can't cook eggs and can't get hash browns brown .
Ordered from Uber Eats so I didn't knew what to expect but I had high hopes....  Paid $30 for 2 sandwiches that were pretty small, didn't even order 2 sandwiches, but at least the brisket was good. Me and a co-worker decided to go in  and expect whatever came to us. When it arrived I was initially confused because we got 2 sandwiches when that wasn't what I ordered, at least that's not what I thought I ordered. In both the app and on their menu online is describes the Midwest Monster as a "heaping pile of Brisket" topped with slaw, cheese, and jalapenos when that's not what it is. Its a small brisket sandwich jalapenos and cheese. I was pretty disappointing because I didn't want a sandwich and if I wanted one I would've ordered a brisket sandwich.  So if you're ordering the Midwest Monster beware because you'll be upset that you got a sandwich like I did and not a pile of delicious meat. My other complaint is that they we're the smallest sides I've ever seen. I ate my Mac & Cheese in 2 bites and although the cornbread was good the same holds true true the size. The sandwich isn't even that big. For paying $10 for a brisket sandwich, 2 sides and $3 more just for jalapenos and cheese is upsetting.  Too bad because it's close to my house but probably never go there ever. Now I know. Please fix your menu description and your app description.
__label__experience_hospitality Well rude staff. Kitchen was dirty.  Waitress forgot my drink...twice and  the bun looked wrinkles and smashed, won't be back for sure.
__label__experience_hospitality Fresh and tasty Sonoran hot dogs. Doesn't get much better. Very nice people also. $17 for 5 hot dogs and coke. Bar with all the side fix ins but it doesn't need it.
__label__experience_hospitality One of my top favourite restaurants in Toronto, Byblos never fails to impress. With the extensive list of drinks, finely made cocktails (die-hard fan of the old fashion and I typically don't drink bourbon), and a wide variety of small/large plates to share, the menu makes each visit a unique experience.  For a party of 3, we ordered the steak tartare, shakshouka, mejadra basmatic rice and a side of brussel sprouts to share. All food items were properly seasoned with spices, and covered sauce and cheese. My favourite is the basmati rice which was finely balanced in texture and flavor with the fried shallots, that was nicely paired with yoghurt dressing. Total came to $42 per person which I thought was reasonable for King West restaurants with drinks as well.   The service was great and I would give it 5+ stars if that was an option!
__label__experience_hospitality Friendly people and inexpensive good breakfast food
__label__experience_environment I could not believe my ears! Almost 55.00 for my family of 5 to get burgers, 2 orders of fries and drinks. I felt like leaving but my whole family was hungry and standing there. Food was ok nothing special by any means.  We threw most of the fries away as not very good.  The place was so loud with the music so loud you couldnt have a conversation so we were forced to eat outside in 100 degree weather. Next time in and out!! Never again.
After reading complaints about their thin noodles, I was pleasantly surprised with the ramen at Sansotei. I ordered the thick noodle Tonkotsu ramen and after the first taste of the soup, I was already impressed and thought it was good compared to just 'okay' experiences at Santouka and other ramen places.  Noodle - The thick noodle I ordered was firm with a nice springy bite which is how I prefer it.  Soup - slightly creamy and pretty salty, but I still enjoyed it (despite by low tolerance for salt). It was a great hot temperature as well and very addictive.  Egg - Softboiled to perfection; sweet almost-runny yolk, soft egg white with slight soy sauce taste - so delicate! Pork - my favorite out of Kinton (flavorful but slightly hard) and Santouka (thin and on the bland side). This was a good size and thickness, great balance of fat and tender meat, flavorful with slightly charred edges.  Sides - green onion really added some fresh taste to the salty soup and noodles. "wood fungus" was nicely cooked.   Tried some Shio broth - salty and more clear than the tonkotsu.   Overall, good bowl of ramen, +1 for the pork, and in a convenient location!
The Tamale Store sets up a booth at the Farmers Market in Anthem - I drive down just to get my Tamale Fix (TF). Pork with Green Chilies - my favorite. Very, very addicting. Even better with their Salsa Verde on top - killer. Not cheap - $33/Dozen - but these are big, very high quality tamales. And they are packaged in Pairs - making it easy to only thaw what you want.
__label__experience_hospitality My husband surprised me with dinner here for our 20th wedding anniversary. It was a perfect evening. We were warmly greeted and seated upon arrival. We had a table with red hearts and a nice anniversary card from Capital Grille. Our server, Ryan David, was exceptional. I know he had other tables but we felt like he was there just for us. The food was delicious. The shrimp cocktail was great and you must try the calamari. Yum! The steaks were juicy and flavorful. The lobster mac and cheese was decadent. I could eat it every day and still want more. We had a wine tasting special at our table. It was fun to see if we could guess what kind each was. The whites were easier than the reds. We had a complimentary dessert duo; cheesecake and something rich & chocolate. The cheesecake was my favorite. I love food and am not easily impressed but I was impressed with my meal. From beginning to end we thoroughly enjoyed every moment. Don Goodwin, the manager, came by our table to see if we were pleased with everything. We were. It was our first visit but it will not be our last. Please dine here at least once. You will be glad you did.
This place is a hidden gem!!  Go early because they can run out nowadays with their growing popularity. Fav's include the meatloaf sammich and the pulled pork. Ribs and fries are amazing.  Great family run business. Keep it up guys!!
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment My husband has been dying to visit a board game cafe for quite some time, it was top of our list when we visited Toronto last month. We were amazed by the selection of games, and how everything ran like a well oiled machine. I love how comfortable the atmosphere is--we played about 4 games, next to us a couple played one more in depth game, and behind us was a mother and son playing more child centered games. There is something truly for everyone! The staff is very friendly and willing to chat, and the menu has a lot of selection, whether you are feeling like you want a meal, or a snack, drinks or coffees...it's a great experience.  We live about an hour and a half away...it's worth the drive just for a visit to Snakes & Lattes!
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment Love the idea of a gourmet pork bun or "bao" place. Very casual atmosphere and standard pork bun price. Nowhere can beat china town pricing anyway or how. Interesting decor of the Chinese calendar zodiac signs as a mural on wall which is a great touch. Food is made fresh and has an amazing aroma. Everyone who works here is quite good looking. Very conveniently located by ttc.
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment I brought a friend here to celebrate getting her permanent residence. We showed up at 9:30pm on a Friday and the place was busy but not packed. Service was fast, friendly, hip, and provided by whoever seems to be the closest. The ambiance is sort of the "new foodie" vibe (it's okay, I want to punch myself in the mouth for saying that): a lot of natural textures, wacky urban decor and the chefs are right there in front of you instead of back in a kitchen.   The burger was epic in a way that the word "epic" does not do justice. For $20 you can order one of each of their five sides, so do that, get a glass of wine or two, and enjoy your evening. Well worth it, and I'll be going back.
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment Excellent lunch spot.  I found this place randomly while looking for something new and different for a downtown lunch.  This place is great to go for a quick sushi or bento lunch.  The service is quick and attentive.  I usually get the bento lunch special, which is a great value and very well apportioned... one could probably make two meals of it with a to-go-box.    It's a bit off the beaten path from the main drag, but it offers one of the best lunch values of downtown.  They don't have a prime location or over the top decor, which allows them to give the lunchgoer a good value. The taste is excellent and the food is fresh and well prepared.  They are staffed well so there is hardly a wait even if it is busy.  I've noticed they play 90s music sometimes, which gives the place a quaint ambiance.  This has become one of my go-to spots downtown.
Great pizza folks. I've had a lot of pizzas in my time but this pizza ranks right up there with the very best I've had. They put generous amounts of toppings on there pizzas and the crust is by far more superior than most other pizza places out there. Don't just take my word on this folks, try one for yourselves. You won't be disappointed.
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment Delicious. Affordale. Enjoyable environment.  Kudos to Jascha and his team for a serving up a great evening on their patio.    We gladly ordered multiple courses of perfectly cooked ribs.  Make sure to try the delicious pecan pie!
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment The highly rated reviews enticed my wife and I to try this place and we can't wait to come back.  Located in a strip mall near the I-17, Banh Mi is very casual and the staff is very helpful. It was apparent we were not familiar with this food yet they explained the menu and provided great recommendations.   We ordered the pork sandwich and a noodle dish to share. In hindsight, one sandwich would have enough in that the portion size are generous.  We also ordered the salmon roll appetizer, which filled us up too. That was really good although I thought it was light on the salmon.  The food was great and I cant wait to try the other selections. One thing I would not try again is the green tea w/milk drink. Maybe others enjoy it yet I thought it tasted like a cup of perfume.  My wife ordered a chai drink and that was really good.  All in all, great place to have close by and will come back with the kids next time.
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment Cute place. Friendly staff. But in the end, it's $8/$9 for a mediocre hotdog. The cool packaging and hip feel definitely don't make up for the food.  Our family ordered five different things off the menu, and none of us are interested in going back.
__label__experience_hospitality My food gets delivered to the table next door. My bill contains charges for both sets of sushi and a "fake" "wrong table" comp that just deducts the mischarge for the double sushi. Horrible way to do business! If I could give ZERO stars, I would.
This place... kinda sucks.  I was craving fries one day, so before taking my lunch break I decided to look up some restaurants in the area that served fries. I settled on this place because they had neat ketchup packets (yes, something as silly as that can convince me to try a place out).  The price of the fries wasn't outrageous. It's also close to where I work, and I walk by it sometimes on my way to other places in the area. So I decided to give it a try.  The fries were terrible. Potato cut, but all very short in length. All very greasy. I'm glad I grabbed a couple of napkins because I ended up trying to soak as much grease as I could from each individual fry before consuming them. It did not taste good at all.  I can't comment on the burgers, but if they're anything like the fries, I would steer clear of those too.
__label__experience_hospitality I've here a few times and the food is great. What I didn't like was the service and the fact that they had lowered prices on yelp but not at their location. Also I highly recommend eating it their, they stiff you on To-go's with portion size and no additional white rice compared to if you were eating their.
__label__experience_hospitality Ha, a flirty waiter always wins points from me.  The service was great--the waiter was friendly, attentive, fast, and knowledgeable about the food.  The food itself is delicious--I shared the bok choy starter (so good!) with my friend, and then I had the pappardelle to myself.  Delicately flavored, with lemon and ricotta, this pasta is an absolute delight.  Desserts are similarly good--the chocolate brownie was surprisingly light, and the lemon posset was just tart enough to complement the richness of the custard.  (Plus we got to overhear the very drunk man at the next table confessing his love for his very uncomfortable blind date--always a good time when it's not you!)
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment Great happy hour specials and meals are some of the best that the fox restaurant group shells out. Parking is limited though. Great place, servers attentive and food excellent ( so are desserts!)
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment Parfait! I enjoyed a perfect meal Thank you Karen W. for recommending the French Onion Soup at Coup Des Tartes and making time for a double Yelp luncheon. Chef prepared a perfectly balanced soup between wine and broth with tender onions. A crouton is baked over with Swiss Gruyere cheese ($10).   For the main meal, I had the Croque Monsieur, a toasted sandwich filled with Mornay sauce, ham, and baked over with Swiss Gruyere. OMG, to die for! The sandwich comes with a choice of Yukon potatoes or salad. The fresh greens lightly dressed in vinaigrette cut the richness of the sandwich beautifully. The portions are large. French cuisine that comes in American portions. Brilliant! My family enjoyed the half I took home.  I had the opportunity to taste the Salmon Nicoise. A generous portion of salmon came with blanched green beans, hard boiled eggs, tomato wedges and in a bed of greens. This came with the classic Nicoise vinaigrette. If you don't see it on the menu, ask for it.  This strategy afforded us the ability to enjoy dessert. We got a 4 berry tart a la mode, and a banana creme brulee. Sadly, I forgot to ask if the tart had nuts. It came with toasted almonds. My Karen generously let me have most of the Banana Creme Brulee with a chocolate crust drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauces.  Patty, our server was hospitable and knowledgeable about the menu. Ron, the owner of Coup des Tartes visited with us and presented the dessert options to us. The atmosphere was charming and a 5 Star experience all round.
__label__experience_hospitality Absolutely abysmal service! Inflated prices seem to match the inflated egos of the owner/wait staff.   They have a very heavy-handed condescension about them which made everyone at our table very uncomfortable. Additionally, charging extra for coal on a shisha is absolutely ridiculous, especially when they only have 2-3 flavours available from their long list of 'advertised' flavours.   Food is not bad, but the portions were so small for the price. It is as if they confuse small portions for an avante-garde experience, but forgot that people also want to eat.   Would recommend many other restaurants for shisha and Irani food. Avoid.
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment After much thought of where we'd brunch amidst the breakfast oasis of options that Phoenix has to offer, I decided upon Phoenix Public Market Café. It was a lazy Sunday around 11:30am, I had time to kill and I was prepared to wait in line. To my surprise, there were only two people in front of me! Wait, what I am I supposed to order? The menu had many salivating options and I was one of those people who just couldn't decide right away. To add to my mental food frenzy, Phoenix is no longer my home and I only return every couple of years so I had to make a good choice.   Thankfully, my girlfriend, a regular at PPMC, came to my rescue and recommended the pork chile verde pot pie. The pork chile verde pot pie was an excellent choice! It was delicious and had the most flaky and buttery crust ever! Pot pies are one of my many guilty food indulgences and this was definitely one of my favorites! The portion size was generous and I did not finish, but maybe it is because I also ate a side of bacon, a lemon and pistachio macaron, and a yummy, large peanut butter cookie sandwich with my meal! What can I say, I'm only in Phoenix every once in a while!  The service at PPMC is friendly and prompt and the ambiance is casual, inviting, and hip. I love the market meets café idea. The outdoor area had picnic style seating and fresh flowers adorned each table. It was a cheerful atmosphere for a wonderful brunch in the beautiful Phoenix sun. My next visit to Arizona, I will surely return to Phoenix Public Market Café and dine again!
My favourite Filipino restaurant in the GTA! We often order the kare kare (beef stew with peanut butter gravy) with extra vegetables (I love eggplant and don't mind more bok choy or string beans) which they always oblige. My wife's favourite is the crispy pata (deep fried ham hocks) which she prefers with the vinegar sauce. My kids love the chicken mami (noodle soup) and Shanghai lumpia (deep fried ground pork or chicken spring rolls). And we all love the halo halo (shaved ice, condensed milk and ice cream dessert with all sorts of goodies mixed in)! Oh, and don't forget the garlic fried rice. If you've never had Filipino food before, this is a great place to start. If you like good, traditional Filipino style homecoming Casa Manila is su casa.
Food is hit and miss... but then menu is funny.  They the traditional soups, but they don't call the soups by their Thai name, Tom kha or Tom yum. I had Tom kha which they call coconut soup, it was quite good with chicken, plenty of chicken and mushrooms.  Second dish is number 70 in the menue, it was a disaster, Pa nang beef, it was soupy, and beef portion was so small that I  had to dig for it, beef was over coocked.  Third dish chicken snd namboo, again vrry small portion of chicken and strangely spiced, this is number 48 on the menue. NEITHER DISHES WAS GOOD. Nice portion of rice, here you pay $2 extra for brown rice. I would rather stick to Wild Thaiger.  The reason I went to this restaurant was because Sunday noon Wild Thaiger is closed!  It is over valued by LOCAL who give it high ranking in Yelp. Mediocare food!
For some reason, I pictured that when ordering a 'Blue Burrito' it would come in a blue corn tortilla.  But it didn't.  (Maybe it used to but Godzilla-sized crows have decimated the blue corn supply? An upset in the food supply as blue corn farmers switch to growing the oh-so-popular quinoa?)    I had the signature Blue Burrito made without meat and without cheese (on that veggie kick again) and it was pretty marginal. Just your usual black bean, rice, salsa affair that was unfortunately tasteless.  The guacamole tasted exceptionally over-mayoed.  Being from Southern California, I always have high expectations for Mexican fare and am routinely disappointed when I'm not dining in my hometown.  Also, I had a little heartache over the fact this puppy set me back $9.39.  Not a great way to begin a 2-hour layover.
__label__experience_environment It's Sunday in Toronto.  You want to meet a friend for brunch and chat. And you want a place where you aren't warehoused in and out the door in less than 45 minutes, while screaming your tonsils raw over ear-splitting music.   Not a dream. It's Avant Gout, by night a French-cum-Moroccan bistro with delectable menu. And by day - weekends only - it's arguably the most brunch-friendly eatery in the city. The classic Eggs Benny comes done to taste with rich Hollandaise and juicy rounds of peameal bacon served with a tender (no iceberg) salad, or cajun fries.  For sheer indulgence, it's the toothsome popping-fresh blueberry pancakes that melt under a drizzle of maple syrup. All served with brio and élan - and some of the city's best coffee, latte or espresso.   Another plus: breaking Toronto's rule of extortionate prices for pleasant food and surroundings, Avant Gout is surprisingly reasonable.  Best of all, you leave with a smile, not a day-long headache.   INFO: 1108 Yonge Street 416-916-3681. They take reservations.
__label__experience_environment All I can say is, meh. The food was okay. The atmosphere okay. But what got me is that I paid $2.95 for chips and salsa and they basically just took stale chips from a bag and put a handful in a basket, not sure how that was worth the price.
Ran into this restaurant for a grab and go juice! I bought the little miss sunshine & it was just what I needed! I will definitely be back for more juice & the food as well!!!
__label__experience_hospitality Holy bad service! Ran out silverware. Forgot order like 3 times. Food cold. Go elsewhere on a sunday morning.
For several months I watched as the window sign saying Appalachia Smokehouse stood mocking me. Telling me smoked meaty goodness was coming to a neighbourhood near me, but for months nothing happened - nothing! I can only equate the many feelings I experienced to that of a dog eagerly waiting his masters return each day, only to be disappointed each time a car drives by and it's not the right one.  One day not too long ago, I noticed the door was open, AND lights were on, AND they were OPEN. Well let me tell you I literally made an excitement puddle right there on the floor (of my car... hey I'd had a lot of coffee that day ok!)  Then the worst thing happened, I went on a vacation! It would be 3 weeks plus before I could sample what I had been dreaming of for months... nay a year!  Then last week the stars aligned, the odds were in my favour, the dice came up, I hit black jack and following a lunch meeting canceling I popped in for a lunch bite! Joy.. rapture!!!  Looking over the menu by day it's basically the healthiest, cleanest pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket sandwiches you can get anywhere close by, and by night (after 5pm) you can specially order some of their smoked ribs to eat in or take away. PRO-TIP: They pre-sell these ribs and they run out fast, they'll have people come in for a sandwich at lunch and order their pick up for dinner at the end of the day... so call ahead to get you name down.  This day I went for the brisket as a combo. Note that I was a little miffed when all a combo came with was fries... no drink. I thought the essence of a combo was to include drink, side and main for a reasonable price. So be prepared to spend a little extra if you need some liquids!  Now back to the brisket! The sandwich comes standard on a toasted ciabatta bun piled high with thick cut grisly brisket topped with caramelized onions and a special sauce. Amazing As is! The brisket while not as flavourful as others I've had was perfectly cooked through and the perfect balance of meat to fat!  Definitely a damn fine sammy and one I'll be back for again soon!  Eatcrest out!
4.5 Stars     These donairs are $@!&)%$ incredible - my simple words can't do them justice so I will keep this review brief.  Just go and try them for yourself....  P.S. - Many say this is the perfect post drinking snack. Not sure about that...  something tells me I'd be finding that delicious donair sauce in odd places the next morning!!!!!!!  BK
It was okay. I compare it to a place back home called Zaxby's. The girl suggested that I order the box so that i could taste all that they had. The tenders were normal tenders, the secret sauce helped them out. The coleslaw was not good. The fries were gross. The best part of the meal was the toast and lemonade.
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment We meet at Local Breeze for a Sunday brunch. I found parking right next to the restaurant. M was already there with a table on the outside patio. There was a wait for the inside. OK, they have mister system and water coolers for the outside patio. It was not too bad. The service on getting our order was a little slow but it seems like she was spread throughout the patio.   They were serving breakfast and lunch. A lot of selection, but since I do not get breakfast food much I had to get the Coke Cola Ham and White Cheddar Cheese Omelet served with country potatoes and wheat bread. The rest of the table got Eggs Benedict and 2 Downtown's Favorite Breakfast. Everything was so good. I love French toast so I must try next time. Loved the atmosphere, but it started to get HOT. It took awhile before we could get our check. If the service can improve, then it would be perfect.
__label__experience_hospitality Wow about sums it up! Found this restaurant off Yelp and it was not a disappointment! The food was absolutely amazing. There were 8 of us and there was not a bad meal. Every time something came out it got an ooo and aww from all of us in unison. From the Meat and Cheese platter to the calamari to the cheese knots, ravioli with lobster cream sauce to the manicotti, to the eggplant rolltini to the cheese cake to the cannoli....well you get the picture. It was all amazing!! And the service was 5 star! They were attentive and couldn't have been nicer. And finally Ian our waiter was wonderful! Made us feel welcome and like part of the family even though we were from California. All I have to say in closing is Ian and the restaurant has made #loyalcrustomer out of us!!!!! We will be back.
Everything here is delicious! Long wait on the weekends but it's worth it. Try visiting on a week day to skip the line. One of the most delicious (and I hear authentic) places in Toronto. Must try!
__label__experience_hospitality My teammates and I were visiting a client in Phoenix, AZ and our client suggested George and Son's. We were in a hurry, so this place seemed to fit the bill since our client mentioned service was pretty quick.  We ordered from the $7.95 lunch menu and I had the Thai Basil Chicken. Lunch also includes egg drop soup, lo mein, crab rangoon, spring roll and white rice. It's a value menu, so you definitely get quite a bit of food for your dollar. Food was on our table in 5-7 minutes from the time we ordered. Overall, everything was so-so, but I did enjoy the lo mein.  I was a little perturbed when I asked if I could substitute hot n' sour soup for the egg drop soup. The server replied tersely, "No, you cannot substitute. The egg drop soup yummy ... you gonna like it!". Okay, I had the egg drop soup and I didn't like it.   Next!
Was craving their salsa because it is one of the best. Lots of flavor and just the right heat. Their new location is great and easy to get to on 40th Street just south of University on the west side of 40th.
__label__experience_environment Man those tacos are good. Weird taste in the corn flour. Hot sauces x 40 to choose from and a salsa bar. Hip hop playing loud and twenty somethings with AD jobs with intellectual glasses on having a Monday night beer staring at a pub across the street. Too loud to over hear and hate them though. Also the root beer is great. Self seating high top only. Number 3 taco place which makes it number 1 of your reading your first taco review. 101 tacos is number 2 and ranch I relaxo is number 1. Unless you're rich enough for a flight to San Diego.
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment The place seem to ONLY serve as a quick stop for people attending a downtown event to get a drink or two prior to the event (The Dodge Theater, Suns or Diamondbacks).  Crowds come early and leave soon there after ... some may return after the event but I wouldn't count on it.  The peeps are either sports fans and/or music fans that enjoy seeing a show sitting down in a cushy seat (i.e. The Dodge Theater).  The fish dinner is good and Brittany the waitress even better (I'm a "big fan") ... but all-in-all ... not my cup of tea.
Dragon balls-deep fried shumai type appetizer. The solid pork shrimp filling reminded me of a super mashed meat formed into a ball. I didn't see what everyone thought was so special.   Tilapia with green curry- 5 stars. Excellent pieces of tilapia, crisp not super greasy crust. Intricate curry ingredients but not sure if the green curry paste was home made, I think it's the canned variety.  Dessert pancake/roti- 1 star, frozen Malaysian parathas which were undercooked and doughy. I was disappointed as this dessert is rare to come by at Thai restaurants in the US
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment Went back for a second try, and YES! Very different experience.  My friend and I sat outside, and were helped within 30 seconds.  The server was friendly, and bonus points, knowledgable about the menu...which looks like it had been revamped in a very, very positive way since my first visit.  The food was excellent. So excellent that even my carnivore friends would rave. This time, the quinoa side had some flavor.  Just to test our server (I'm fun like that), I asked about the ingredients, and she knew them off the top of her head.   The portion size was great.  We both ordered wraps, and both had leftovers to take with us. Sitting outside in January is tough to beat, especially in the brick-paved and fountain-laden Town & Country plaza.  I'm going with 4 stars because the interior and the furnishings need a little bump towards nicer. The decor still feels like "I'm a college hippy," and the food and concept deserve better.  The bathroom was cute, but if you don't like smelling like incense (and I don't), avoid it.  But really, kudos to Chakra.  They listened to the reviews and made an about-face.  Oh! And someone (the owner?) emails a newsletter that is worth reading. Not just a "come eat at my place" (in fact, I don't think he has said that, yet), but useful information on herbs, supplements and food.   I'm a fan.
__label__experience_hospitality This place is AMAZING!!!! After a disappointing experience at the bites and brews festival we found this little gem. The food was outstanding. The Buffalo chips had the perfect blend of heat and blue cheese. The Philly chips that my girl friend had was outstanding as well. What topped it off for us was our server Kelsey, she was fun, personable and attentive. Definitely a must for anyone that is headed downtown.
Not bad.  I don't have a lot of experience with Gluten free goods yet.  I would say this place is good but I wasn't wowed.  Definitely recommended if you are in the area but not worth a far trip.  I found the cupcakes to be a bit dry and the icing way too sweet.  Cookies are very sweet also.  This is a takeout only place.
__label__experience_hospitality Finally, a good Izakaya in Yonge and Sheppard area. I love the Udon salad!!! its sooo gooooood you have to try it. YOU MUST. They have fresh oyster special on Tuesdays and Wednesdays? or Thursday. (I went on Tuesday night so not sure about the other day) Fresh oyster is only $1 for a piece. Average price for drinks, I beleive a pitcher of Sapporo was $16? but I had large cans of sapporo ($7) bc their draft was dried up and kubota cold sake.  The food items  are unique, never seen them before in other places. I had Salad Udon, which they have udon noodle in a salad with 5 huge shirmps with awesome dressing. I loved it. I am definitely gonna go back for this. Samurai Crunch, it was also good, kind of similar to salad udon, black cod yaki, dozen of oyster special. creamy potato (also very good) Food are so good that eventhough it's an izakaya I might go just for food. Actually a couple next to my table were having dinner without drinks. Our waitress Sylvia was very professional polite and courteous. BUt she was the only server so she was in rush serving people. She forgot our sake cups...   oooo and we also had a complimentary bowl of edamame but I'm pretty sure that everyone in the restaurant got it too.
Over priced. They ran out of food and plates!! This is the second time that something!!
OMG...the most delish burritos in Leaside.  The quality and portions are good for the price and you are able to custom build the burrito to suit your taste.  Everything is freash and the service is quick.  The beer and desert selection is not great so I wouldn't recommend either.
__label__experience_hospitality I eat here weekly for lunch if I can, as do many of my colleagues. Reasonably-priced and a good variety (bento boxes, tempura, sushi, sashimi, udon-just skip the pork). Friendly, if rushed, staff. Pricier at night but an easy dinner out.
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment Really delicious food and great ambiance (it seemed like we were one of the few non-Brazilians in the restaurant). Food arrives slowly, but worth the wait if you're not in a rush! The server (only one in the restaurant, which is probably why things were moving a bit slowly) was awesome, helping us navigate the menu and making recommendations...she handled our large group very kindly. Great place overall!
Great food, can't wait to go back.  The meat was fresh and hot, just remember to turn over your "meat wanted" indicator otherwise they just keep bringing more to you.  I will pass on the Brazilian soda in a can though.
__label__experience_environment we ate this sunday there. it was great. im a strict vegetarian and my husband is a meat eater but loves veggies as well. ok, so one by one what i liked... - the atmosphere. extremely, super relaxing, even invited u to meditate with the music they had.  - the variety of food, wow, it took us so long to decide, there were so many options, so many styles that it was very difficult to decide.  i had the fake chicken with mango, asparagus, ginger, carrots. when my order came let me tell u everyone around was looking over and asking the waitress what was that...because it was so colorful, the veggies were perfectly cooked, not too much, not too little. usually i dont like fake meats, but this one absolutely thumbs up, it was so tender and tasty. all my plate was a perfect blend of flavours without using any invasive spice.  my husband had the chicken thai and he was so happy with it.  - so much food we took some home.  - so healthy, not ur typical place were u settle for a veggie option but here u have a real delightful experience.  - we also had 2 spring rolls each - and a teapot of jazmine tea   all of this came to $43 (there are cheaper options, like combinations and menus, we decided we wanted something more elaborated, hence, the price)  the place is spacious, no one was rushing us, the waitresses were all so nice ready to answer any question.  is not just a place to eat, is a vegetarian experience to enjoy.
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment Went to this cozy little establishment for brunch on a complete hangover morning.  The waitress was very friendly and pleasant and made my food selection   Can't really comment on my food as I only had a fruit salad with smoked salmon and toast on the side.  Presentation was nice, but all i could taste was the rum & cokes from the night before.    The rest of my party had beautifully fluffy waffles, a soup that looked well made and a decently packed sandwich.  Seems like the perfect place if you want to brunch and read the paper by yourself for a calm 'ease into my weekend' type morning.  During the week however, I imagine it can get quite busy with all the offices around.
__label__experience_hospitality __label__experience_environment Excellent food and service, on the pricey side for the Beach, but well worth it for the 8 - 10 visits we have experienced. Nice new patio to give them more outdoor seating.
This place cut off the protein pinnacle of the food pyramid to make a depressing food trapezoid.   Pros: Wide selection of vegetarian options... including the meat ones. There is adequate butter in the butter chicken.  Within walking distance to better burritoed food options.  Cons: Poverty protein will catabolize your heard earned gains. Made to order = long waits, stiff vegetables. Spicy scale depends on how you're racially profiled. Can vary from Michael Cera harmless to subcontinent fury. The bright signage keeps me up at night.
I went to Bunner's Bake Shop because like a zombie sustained by butter tarts, BlogTO told me it had one of the best tarts in town*. Well actually, I was in the area incidentally, so why not? I knew nothing else about this Junction bakery--I love going to places serendipitously blind.   Upon arrival, besides the cute cartoony storefront, I learned that Bunner's (a name that kind of reminds me of a Pokémon--the cartoony front doesn't help) does only gluten-free AND vegan-friendly goodies. It is so far the only bakery in Toronto that does both AND only both.  Wait a minute, does that mean I'm about to eat what amounts to BUTTERLESS butter tarts?! How does that work out?  Not so bad actually. It has the visual texture of a high quality bakery butter tart, and taste a tad better than the best supermarket tarts, without being overly sweet. The filling is a bit runny, which I don't like. And it has raisins, which I don't mind but others will. A decent good pass, as in, "I can't believe it's not butter."  And I stared at their cupcakes and other treats, wondering what on earth gluten-free vegan cupcakes are like. Really, Steve?  The cupcakes ($3-4 for fresh ones; $2.5 for day-olds) leaves something more to be desired of a cupcake. Beer and bacon is an interesting flavour for a place like this; it is heavy on simulated bacon flavours, and topped with what I like to call "mystery meat" (simulated bacon bits made of coconut). Interesting. The cake base held together well with some damp softness. But what peeved me was how oily the cupcakes were.   You can definitely though taste the passion of this business. Watching the bakers at work behind the counter of this tiny shop (forget about eating in; this is all takeout), they are filling a market void in the city, where those glad a bakery like Bunner's exist can finally have their cake and eat it too. I am not a vegan nor buy into the gluten-free diet thing, so the "OMG! Vegan! Gluten-free!" craze doesn't faze me, but for the most part for me food is food. I do know people suffering from celiac disease though, and they could care less about the consequences the moment a cupcake of any origin is shown in their face. Probably because they never heard of Bunner's. What would they think if they did? And while I don't profess to be an expert on gluten-free food either (hell, I know nothing), I have been warned that gluten-free (and to mix that with veganism?!) grub tend to taste bland. Bunner's not completely tasteless, thank goodness, but they certainly are not perfect either (as I wipe way all this oil coming off from the cupcakes).  Maybe if I'm around next time I will be sure to try other goodies they are raved by many to excel at. Like their cinnamon buns--also declared one of the best by BlogTO**.  {TTC: the 30 or 40 bus to Dundas/Quebec will get you here. You're very welcome.}  REFERENCES: * http://www.blogto.com/toronto/the_best_butter_tarts_in_toronto/ ** http://www.blogto.com/toronto/the_best_cinnamon_buns_in_toronto/  BONUS GLUTEN-FREE VEGANNESS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD: Soon after my visit, the CBC's Metro Morning did a feature on Bunner's.

__label__experience_hospitality Bombbbbbbbb, amazing food. I love this place so much that i frequent here about 2 times a week. The service is outstanding! Edgar, Daniel and Ariella are too sweet and they always know what im going to order.   The fish taco is a standout, tasty and sustainably sourced. The red sauce they use on it is very mild though almost like a marinara but it works with that crispy fish fillet. Yummm.   My ultimate favorite though is the gourmet chicken taco, holy taste buds!  Let me break it down for you. Served on a corn tortilla with a melted goey white cheese and a crispy layer of cheddar cheese im guessing, crusted on the tortilla like a damn cheese crisp. Atop that is the grilled chicken, red tomatillo sauce that is very flavorful and mild, a creamy chipotle sauce, fresh onions and cilantro and then of coarse bacon!   YOU MUST GO NOW!!!
